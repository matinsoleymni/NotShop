# Pages

These components are typically rendered by the route components defined in the `app/routes/` directory, which handle the mapping of URL paths to the appropriate page components.

## home/

The `home/` subdirectory contains components related to the home page.

## profile/

The `profile/` subdirectory contains components related to the profile page.
