# Pages

The `app/pages/` directory contains the top-level React components that represent the different views or "pages" of the application. These components are typically rendered by the route components defined in the `app/routes/` directory, which handle the mapping of URL paths to the appropriate page components.


## product/

The `product/` subdirectory contains components related to the product details page.

- `index.tsx`: The main product details page component, mapped to the `/product/:product` route.
