# Routes

The `app/routes/` directory contains the route components for the application. These components are used by the router to render different pages based on the URL.

- `home.tsx`: The route component for the home page, mapped to the `/` route.
- `product.tsx`: The route component for the product details page, mapped to the `/product/:product` route.
- `profile.tsx`: The route component for the user profile page, mapped to the `/profile` route.
